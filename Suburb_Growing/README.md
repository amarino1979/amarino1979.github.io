## Features
- Designed simply so that you can select your vegetable from a dropdown list.
- Dropdown was put into alphabetical order.
- When selecting the vegetable I ordered the populated fields in a sequential order that moves from seed to harvest.
- In the footer I included a contact button that when clicked turns into a modal in which you can connect with us.

## Future Development
- Wanting to find a way to include the vegetable image for each item selected.
- Build a local hosting site for anyone who is filling out the modal.
- Create a user account which will save their own garden data and give them ways to query what grows best by zipcode and time of year.
